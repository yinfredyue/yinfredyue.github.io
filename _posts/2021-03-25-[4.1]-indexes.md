Indexes in DBMS: Hash table; B+ tree; Trie and radix tree; inverted index.

## Data Structures in DBMS

A DBMS uses various data structures:
- Internal meta-data: keep track of information about the database and the system state.
- Core data storage: the base storage for tuples in the database.
- Temporary data storage: the DBMS build it on the fly and discard after use.
- Table Indexes: a replica of a subset of a table's columns organized in some way to allow DBMS to find tuples more quickly than performing a sequential scan. The indexes and the tables must be kept in sync.

## Hash Table

A hash table maps key to values. It provides on average O(1) time complexity and O(n) space complexity.

A hash table consists of two parts:
- **Hash function**: how to map a larger key space into a smaller domain. Trade-off between fast execution vs. collision rate.
- **Hashing scheme**: how to handle key collisions after hashing. Trade-off between allocating a large hash table vs. additional operations for for reads/writes.

### Hash Functions

Skipped. Not our focus.

### Hashing Schemes

#### Static Hashing Schemes

The table contains a **fixed** number of slots. When a static hash table is full, the DBMS has to rebuild a larger table. 

- **Linear Probe Hashing**: The most common static scheme. Resolve conflict by linearly searching for th next free slot in the table.
    - Must store `<key | value>`, to know when to stop scanning. 
    - To support deletions, use either "Tombstone" or "Movement".
- **Robinhood Hashing**: skipped.
- **Cuckoo Hashing**: skipped.

#### Dynamic Hashing Schemes

A dynamic hash table can resize on demand, without rebuilding the entire table. 

- **Chained Hashing**: The most common dynamic scheme. The table maintains a linked list of bluckets for each slot in the hash table. 
    - Resolve conflitcts by placing elements with same hash key into the same bucket.
    - If a bucket is full, add another bucket to the chain. 
- **Extendible Hashing**: Improved variant of chained hashing that splits buckets instead of letting chains grow forever. 
- **Linear Hashing**: skipped.

### Comments

A hash table is usually not suitable for a table index, because it takes O(n) space and doesn't support range query.

## B+ Tree

A B+ tree is a self-balancing tree that keeps data sorted, allowing searches, sequential access, insertions, deletions in O(log(n)) time. It's optimized for disk-oriented DBMS that read/write large blocks of data.

Formally, a B+ tree is an *M-way* search tree and:
- It's perfectly balanced (all leaf nodes are at the same depth).
- Every inner node other than the root is at least half full (M/2 - 1 <= # of keys <= M-1)
- Every inner node with k keys has k+1 non-null children.

Every node in a B+ tree contains an array of key/value pairs:
- Arrays at every node are sorted by the keys.
- The value array for inner nodes contains pointers to other nodes.
- Two approaches for leaf node values:
    - Record ID: a pointer to the location of the tuple
    - Tuple data: the actual contents of the tuple

### Insertion

```
find correct leaf L
Add new entry into L in sorted order
if L has enough space:
    return
otherwise: 
    split L into two nodes L and L'. 
    Redistribute entries evenly and COPY UP middle key. 
    Insert index entry pointing to L' into parent of L. This may require split again.
To split an inner node, redistribute entries evenly , but PUSH up the middle key.
```

### Deletion

```
find correct leaf L
Remove the entry
if L is at least half full
    return
else if redistribute possible
    redistribute
else
    merge L and sibling
If merge occured, delete entry in the parent pointing to L. This causes recursive delete.
```

### Implementation-level Pseudo Code
The following implementaion-level pseudo code is from *Database System Concepts*.

Each node has at most n-1 keys and n values. For leaf node, $P_{n}$ is the `next` pointer.

### B+ Tree Design Decisions

- Node size: the slower the disk, the larger the optimial node size.
- Merge threshold: delay a merge operation may reduce the amount of reorganization. Periodically rebuild the tree instead.
- Variable length keys: Cannot store key/value in an array and access with index. Solutions:
    - Pointers: Store pointers to key attributes, which are stored somewhere else. Rarely used.
    - Variable-length Nodes: requires careful memory management. Rarely used.
    - Padding: always pad the key to be max length of the key type.
    - Key Map: embed an (possibly sorted) array of pointers that map to the key+value entries in the node. Most common.
- Non-unique indexes:
    - Duplicate keys: store duplicate keys multiple times.
    - Value lists: store each key only once and maintain a linked list of unique values.
- Intra-node search:
    - Linear
    - Binary search
    - Interpolation

### B+ Tree Optimizations

- Prefix compression: Sorted keys in the same <u>leaf node</u> are likely to have the same prefix. Instead of storing the entire key each time, extract common prefix and store only unique suffix for each key.

- Suffix truncation: Keys in the <u>inner nodes</u> are only used to "direct traffic". Instead of storing the entire key, store a minimum prefix needed to correctly route probes into the index.

- Bulk insert: the fastest way to build a B+ tree is to sort the keys and then build the tree bottom-up, as this avoids splits or merges.

## More Index Usages
- Implicit index: most DBMSs automatically create an index to enforce integrity constraits (e.g. primary key, unique constraints)
- Partial index: create an index on a subset of the entire table (e.g. only index frequently-accessed items). This reduces size and overhead to maintain it.
- Covering index: all attributes needed for the query are stored in the index, then the DBMS doesn't need to retrieve the tuple. The DBMS can complete the entire query using data available in the index (index-only query).
- Index include columns: Embed additional columns in index to support index-only queries. These additional columns are only stored in the leaf nodes and are NOT part of the search key. 
- Function/Expression indexes: store the output of a function/expression as the key instead of the oroginal value.

## Trie and Radix Tree

Observation: the inner node keys in a B+ tree cannot tell you whether a key exists in the index. You must traverse to the leaf node (and possibly have one page miss per level). 

### Trie

A [trie]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)) examines prefixes of keys, instead of the entire key.  

The shape of a trie only depends on key space and length. It doesn't depend on existing keys or insertion order, and doesn't require rebalancing operations. All operations have O(k) complexity, where k is the key length. 

Exercise: [Implement Trie](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/).

### Radix Tree

A variant of a trie. Instead of storing a node for each element/letter in the key, nodes are consolidated to represent the largest common prefix before keys differ. 

```
To index:
0000 0000
0000 0001
0000 0011

trie:
        [0, 1]
         v      
        [0, 1]
         v      
        [0, 1]
         v      
        [0, 1]
         v      
        [0, 1]
         v
        [0, 1] ----+
         v         v
        [0, 1]     [0, 1]
        v              v
      [0, 1]       [0, 1]
       v  v            v
0000 0000  0000 0001   0000 0011

radix tree:
        0000 00
         v    v
         0    11
        / \
       0   1

```

## Inverted Indexes

An inverted index stores a mapping from words to records to contains those words in the target attributes.
