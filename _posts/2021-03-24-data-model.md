A *database management system* (DBMS) is the software that manages a database.

## Data models

A *data model* is a collection of concepts for desribing the data in a database.

A *schema* is a description of a particular collection of data, using a given data model.

Many existing data models: Relational mode, key/value, document, graph, ...

## Relational model

A *relation* is an unordered set containing the relationship of attributes that represent entities.

A *tuple* is a set of attribute values in the relation. We use *row* and tuple interchangably.

A relation with *n* attributes is called an *n-nary relation*. 

### Keys

Foreign key.
