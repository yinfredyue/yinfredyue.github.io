# WSL2 Proxy Setup

After the internship, I switched from Mac to Windows again. I need to setup WSL2 to use proxy.



## Basic ideas

Concepts for layman: 

- Proxy server: the actual servers handling traffic, redirecting network requests.
- Proxy client: the software you downloaded. Typically, the user instruction asks you to copy some link and "update server subscription". This step gets information about proxy servers.

When you enable proxy on Windows, go to "Settings > Network & Internet > Proxy", and you should see some proxy `ip:port` enabled. All network traffic are redirected here, which is sent to the proxy server.

The goal is to redirect WSL2 traffic to the same proxy `ip:port`.



## Approach

This is done through environment variables `ALL_PROXY`, `http_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `https_proxy`, `HTTPS_PROXY`. As explained here: https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/2122#issuecomment-302153759.

However, for some reason, WSL2 doesn't support accessing host machine using `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` (The reason is that WSL1 shares network ports with Windows host, while WSL2 is a virtual machine essentially, and doesn't share network ports with the host). Thus, we have to find the IP address of the host machine. Go to "Settings > Network & Internet > Status > Network Status > Properties" to find the `IPv4 Address` of the Windows host. Replace into `~/.bashrc`.

This should have worked, except for one detail. You should enable the proxy client to serve the traffic from WSL2, which is denied by default. Thus, choose "Enable connection from LAN"/“允许局域网连接” (this is typically not enabled by default, if your proxy client doesn't have this setting available, you might need to change to another client software). Then traffic from WSL2 should be directed to the proxy client on Windows.



## Verification

How to verify that you are successfully connected to the proxy in WSL2?

Initially I do `ping www.google.com`, but I always get 100% packet loss, while `curl www.google.com` sometimes works. Thus, clearly we shouldn't use `ping www.google.com` to verify.

Determining the location of your current IP address is a better way. Use `curl -s https://icanhazip.com` to get the IP address. And use `geoiplookup` to look up the loaction of the IP.

```
$ sudo apt install geoip-bin
$ curl -s https://icanhazip.com
172.104.175.239
$ geoiplookup 172.104.175.239
GeoIP Country Edition: SG, Singapore
```

Or you can do it in one shot:

```
$ geoiplookup $(curl -s https://icanhazip.com)
```

Based on the location, if can verify if you are successfully connected to proxy.
